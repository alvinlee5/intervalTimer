# intervalTimer

I have since stopped working on this one since I wanted to drastically change the design of the app. I thought it'd be easier to start new, so I just started a new project instead of changing this one. See TimerV2 in my repo. :) 

~~I decided to start this project after my 3rd year semester 1 exams (Dec. 20, 2016). I was curious to see if I could make a
nice Android app, so I decided to start with an interval timer, because I'm a fan of HIIT, and also because I felt like it
would be something reasonable to start with for the purpose of learning Java and Android.

~~As of Jan. 8, 2017, the timer is functional, but still needs some work before it can make it onto the App Store. It might take
some time before it's fully complete though, since I'm back in school for another 4 months. I'll still be working on it throughout
the semester though.

~~I decided to push my project onto Github on Jan 10. 2017, mostly so I could start keeping track of my own work (version control and
all that), and to learn git.
